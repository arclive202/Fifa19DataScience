# Fifa19DataScience

This Repository is used for storing all my Personal Projects that I have worked on for implementing concepts of EDA and ML on FIFA datasets

Arsenal.IPYNB - Using exploratory data analysis to gain insight into the different team and their statistics in the Fifa 19 Game, and also using multiple data frames to gain insight into the statistics of a particular team "Arsenal FC"


FifaStatsPredictor.IPYNB - Using XGBRegressor to create a simple model which can be used to train a Fifa dataset to compute the Overall, Potential, Player Value and the Player Wage from a given set of user Inputs.
